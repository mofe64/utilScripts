"review":"The Room Cafe in Victoria Island offers a lovely atmosphere with a modern and stylish decor. The food was enjoyable with a good variety of dishes to choose from, and the drinks were well made. However, the service was a bit slow and could use some improvement. Overall, if you're looking for a nice place to grab a bite and relax, the Room Cafe is definitely worth considering."
