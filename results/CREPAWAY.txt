"review":"Crepaway in Victoria Island has a nice ambience and the decor is trendy. The food is decent, although some dishes are a bit hit or miss. The service is friendly but can be a bit slow during peak times. Prices are reasonable for the portion sizes you get. Overall, if you're looking for a casual dining spot with a good vibe, Crepaway could be worth checking out."
