"review":"Based on the review of Placebo Magodo, it appears that the restaurant has a nice ambience and decor, and the food is decent. The reviewer particularly enjoyed the chicken wings and the pepper soup. However, the service was slow and the prices were a bit high. Overall, if you are looking for a nice atmosphere and decent food, Placebo Magodo may be worth a visit."
