"review":"Thai Thai in Victoria Island has a vibrant and colourful atmosphere that creates a lively dining experience. The menu offers a variety of Thai dishes with a decent range of vegetarian options. The Pad Thai and Tom Yum soup were particularly tasty. The service was prompt and friendly. However, the portion sizes were a bit small for the price. Overall, if you're looking for a fun and flavourful Thai meal, Thai Thai is worth a visit."
