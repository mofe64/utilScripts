"review":"Based solely on the review provided, it appears that 343 Degrees North Hartleys Restaurant in VI has a pleasant atmosphere, with a beautiful view and a comfortable seating area. However, the review notes that the food was not up to par, particularly the seafood which was overcooked and the cocktails were not well-made. Additionally, the service was slow. Taking these factors into consideration, it may be best to consider other dining options in the area."
