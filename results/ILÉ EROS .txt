"review":"Ile Eros offers a unique dining experience with its beautiful decor and ambiance. The restaurant is well designed with a mix of modern and traditional elements that create a warm and inviting atmosphere. However, the food quality was inconsistent during our visit, some dishes were good while others were not up to par. The prices were also a bit on the high side. On the plus side, the service was prompt and attentive. Overall, if you are looking for a good ambiance and decent food, Ile Eros might be worth a try."
