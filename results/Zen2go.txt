"review":"Zen2Go offers a unique and refreshing dining experience with its fusion of Asian and Nigerian cuisine. The restaurant has a modern and welcoming atmosphere with an open kitchen that adds to the dining experience. The food is well-prepared, flavorful, and presented beautifully. The service is also commendable, with friendly and attentive staff. The only downside is that the prices are a bit on the high side, but the quality of the food and service make it worth it. Overall, I would definitely recommend a visit to Zen2Go for a memorable dining experience."
